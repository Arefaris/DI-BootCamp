DAY 1
- What is a database - storage data in an organized way
- What is a relational database - tables can be related 
- What is SQL - Structured Query Language
- What Postgres - RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) tool
- What PGadmin - GUI

Tables structure
- a field = the "label" of a column 
- a record or a row = one of the entries/ a row
- a column = a vertical entity contains all the associated info for that field
- a NULL value = absence of a value (different than zero or undefined)

Data Types
- numeric - integer, decimal, smallint, serial, and more...
- string - varchar(size), text, and more...
- Date/time - timestamp, date, and more...
- Boolean: true or false

- HOW TO
- create a database
- create a table: defining data types and constrains
- retrieve data (select, where, limit, offset, order by, returning)
- update data or table
- delete data or table (data using where)
- alter: change the structure of the table (add a column, change a data type, change the name of a field)


DAY2
primary key = index of the row (int, unique, not null, serial)
foreign key = a column that creates a relation between two tables
joins = are different ways of displaying related data 
default join = INNER JOIN 
LEFT JOIN
RIGHT JOIN
FULL JOIN


DAY3
ON DELETE AND ON UPDATE OPTIONS:
-restrict
-cascade
-no action (default)
-set default
-set null

RELATIONSHIPS:
-one to one (teudat zeut table and passaport table)
-one to many (orders table and items table)
-many to many (movies and actors table) - it is represented by a cross-reference table
