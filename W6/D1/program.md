## Data Types

- **Numeric**: `integer`, `decimal`, `smallint`, `serial`, etc.  
  *Used for numbers. `integer` is for whole numbers, `decimal` for precise decimals, `smallint` for smaller ranges, and `serial` auto-increments values (often used for IDs).*

- **String**: `varchar(size)`, `text`, etc.  
  *Used for text. `varchar(size)` limits the number of characters, while `text` allows for long, unlimited-length strings.*

- **Date/Time**: `timestamp`, `date`, etc.  
  *Used for storing dates and times. `timestamp` includes both date and time, while `date` stores only the date.*

- **Boolean**: `true` or `false`  
  *Used for logical values, representing either true or false.*
